This version overhauls the Lunar commands.
* Add an extra parameter to `forceEvent` that allows you to overwrite the current moon event (`/lunar forceEvent <eventId> <forceCurrent`)
* Add a skip command that skips the current event (`/lunar skip`)
* Add a command to re-roll the current event (`/lunar randomize`)
